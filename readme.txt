Welcome to dodger!
The project is divided into three parts:

-the template: first version of the game. Acts as starting-point for main projects.

-Bot-Version: fully automated game. Currently just the simple game

-Human-Version: Dodger created for humans. Contains menues, improved graphics and level design
