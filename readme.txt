Welcome to dodger!
The project is divided into three parts:

-the template: first version of the game. Acts as starting-point for main projects.

-AI-version: Dodger, but controlled by a learning AI(TODO)

-Human-version: Dodger created for humans. Contains menues, improved graphics and level design
